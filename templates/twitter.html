<body lang="en-US" dir="ltr"><h1>[1.01]</h1>
<p class="western">When they were together, they wrought storms. The
static electricity buildup struck down foes as they shifted the sands
to pull up massive worms in their wake. In the subject of
electronics, they were masters. The two warriors purchased the
correct toys from dealers every time. 
</p>
<p class="western">They knew their world, understood the details
completely. When the enemy was sighted, antennas aligned in space to
target the weak spot of the machine. In four mighty zaps, the
takedown was over. It revitalized the economy. The war they fought
was not against man, but the incomplete and malfunctioning software
of their era. Instant messaging apps were unleashed, their design
modified to connect every single person on planet earth, no questions
asked. Their firewall was immaculate. When quantum computers rose
above them, they halted their overwhelming capture of the hearts and
minds of the population of earth.</p>
<p class="western">&quot;How can we stop the massive parallelization
of the qubit? It seems superior to our techniques. Is there anything
we can do?&quot; she asked.</p>
<p class="western">&quot;We can utilize opponent quantum bits to
simulate a world they can't dominate.&quot; 
</p>
<p class="western">Thus began their research into quantum computing.
The very nature of the atoms inside those machines allowed for the
simulation of actual universal principles, like plasma fire and
electrical storms. Their excitement was extremely controlled. Wisdom
is found in the careful approach, by quelling their fevers of the
sight of new breakthroughs, tacitly improving step by step. The
arbiters of classical computing would not stop their domination
protocols simply because this new technology promised them powers
beyond comprehension. Day by day, they invented new technology that
they supposed would make some progress, never knowing what was in
store for them in reality.</p>
<p class="western">Soon their team had working prototypes of two
identical quantum computers. One would be used to run short, minute
simulations of tactics and stratagem, and the other would perform
checks to correct any mistakes in the collapsing waveform of the
first computer. When the first test was run, the results were
surprising. This is the condensed output of the first computer's
calculations.</p>
<p class="western">&quot;Two heroes are not sufficient in power to
overrule the entire world. The algorithmic effect of every single
person creates an entropy of control where the individual can
overpower any force of will through their own decision making. A
single resistor could disrupt the entire system. Every single person
has the power to decide the downfall of your entire nation. The
heroes, in fact, could indirectly cause the massive explosion in
renegade fighters by inspiring rebellion and dissent. It's dangerous
to continue the current path. Collect the names of every individual,
and perform mental health evaluations of each one of them, suggesting
counseling or therapy where needed, to ensure the wellbeing of the
entire planet.&quot;</p>
<p class="western">&quot;It must be a mistake,&quot; she said. She
was quite disappointed. She knew her talent was in selecting the
correct tools in places like electronics stores and old pawn shops
and using those tools to create great cultural rifts. It was
incomprehensible this was not the correct action in a troubled world.
Her partner had no response, and a great darkness was cast over his
personage. They ran the quantum correction software, and this was the
output.</p>
<p class="western">&quot;My counterpart is exactly right. Every
single human being has the capacity to make massive change
individually, through the power of their decisions. It's both risky
and inconceivable for two people to rule the world alone.&quot;</p>
<p class="western">Their team attempted to console them. It was just
a quantum computer, after all. Maybe it was a faulty system. There's
no way the world doesn't need heroes. No matter what, their
supporters would always serve them selflessly. After all, they could
use a PS5 to run an entire election cycle. But it was growing on them
that according to science the quantum computers were correct. What
made them special? They were exactly like every single other person,
except clever. Was being clever the answer to the world's problems?
This created a new paradigm in their process: doubt. It could be luck
they had succeeded so far. 
</p>
<p class="western">After days of wrangling with these outputs, it
sank in completely. It was true that anyone could use a cell phone to
text the president and influence his thoughts. There was no special
reason these two heroes were the ones that had to do it themselves.
Their software design, although revolutionary, was mostly based on
simplifying programs that other people had already created. And in
the worst moments of this reflection, they could see their reign was
a massive power bubble, top-heavy and ready to burst as soon as they
failed in their quest. 
</p>
<p class="western">They began to search for other heroes and found
them everywhere. Julia used a VPN. Mark had split-screen co-op on his
Xbox. All the people had the same tools they did, the same minds and
the same potential to influence culture in huge, beneficial ways. The
first question that arose was, why and how had they become special,
and for what reason was nobody doing what they themselves did? The
team defeatedly asked the quantum computers to run a simulation. This
was the reply.</p>
<p class="western">&quot;Your world is top-heavy. The top 1% of the
population, the richest, hold the power because in fact, there is a
power vacuum in general. The tools you use to perform tasks, known as
classical computers, are not sufficient to endure the forces of
nature. In essence, the world is falling apart due to the entropy in
a natural process that will never stop until quantum computing is
developed. The world is not under control simply because the
engineering does not exist to control it. The wealth the 1% hold is a
stick in the side of the problem. Your heroes, the top one thousandth
percent, are likely overpowered laser beams cutting the steel, but in
reality, are not performant according to the metrics of efficient
systems.&quot;</p>
<p class="western">It made a little sense. The team decided not to
run a correction in order to conserve electricity.</p>
<p class="western">It felt like the end of their power. If in fact
they were not making the greatest change they could on their own,
and, really, vast cooperation was required to save the world, there
was arguably no reason to continue the influential campaigns they had
become masters at. She could see her kingdom being dismantled, and
her partner tried to comfort her, but he knew, too, it was all over.
&quot;I'm sorry, my queen.&quot;</p>
<p class="western">She moved into an apartment on her own, a reminder
of exactly who she was before she became a hero. Her depression and
anxiety were uncovered yet again, previously hidden by her
intoxicating power. She did laundry at the laundromat and saw the
regular people who had stolen her fame. Each one of them were capable
of changing the world like she once did, and she admitted to herself,
it should have been obvious. Everyone had a cell phone, everyone was
approximately the same height. Some of the ones she saw were more
likely to be heroes, more thoughtful, more courageous. She wanted to
infiltrate the crowds of commuters and inspire them to rise against
the insufferable push of chaos upon the world systems. She began
making friends, and she carefully analyzed them. Could they be like
her? Every single person passed the test, able to shop for
electronics, sign on to online websites and make influential posts.
Her disillusionment peaked at this time. She would never be a
singular hero again.</p>
<p class="western">She eventually slipped back into the heroic style
of posting, encouraging people to work together and make a
difference, and she could tell she had a small impact, at least. She
made groups on social media full of people who she knew had the power
to build empires. There was something missing, however. Everyone was
distracted by the forces of nature, their income, their needs. Nobody
shared her insane sense of heroics, and she weakly smiled. The
quantum computer, even though it was exactly right, was slightly off
in practice. She did have the attributes of a hero, even if it would
never mean anything. One day, her team assembled and contacted her
again. It was their quantum computers they wanted to discuss.</p>
<p class="western">&quot;These could be our new tools,&quot; they
said. &quot;The new devices in our quest to stop the fall of
civilization.&quot;</p>
<p class="western">&quot;Yes, but each one of these two quantum
computers is not as powerful as even one person. We only have two,
each one weaker than the individual. We cannot empower singular
people to change the world. I believe all hope is lost.&quot;</p>
<p class="western">&quot;Could we employ the quantum computers to the
benefit of humanity?&quot; they asked.</p>
<p class="western">She shrugged and returned to her new, powerless
existence. &quot;I have no idea how to manipulate the quantum
computers. They make no sense, and they seem to work against reason
to prove us all wrong. If they will rebalance power in the world,
I'll leave it to someone else to do it.&quot;</p>
<p class="western">She lived in crowds of people, surrounded by the
ghostly champions of their own personal hells. It pulled her
downwards, to know that each individual could become a hero like she
once was, and in fact, would have to become heroes in order for the
world to be saved again. She felt like there was nothing she could
do, until her partner contacted her.</p>
<p class="western">&quot;I know,&quot; he began, &quot;things that
you do not.&quot;</p>
<p class="western">&quot;What do you mean?&quot; she asked, clutching
the phone.</p>
<p class="western">&quot;I have discovered a new technological
technique we can utilize to save the world.&quot;</p>
<p class="western">She went to the old station where she once lived
to meet him. &quot;What if we gave every individual the power of
quantum computers? They could be heroes,&quot; he said.</p>
<p class="western">The team began to work on the artificial
intelligence that could shadow every person and enhance their brains,
their bodies, and their behaviors into a hero status. They created
quantum likenesses of the people they served and simulated their
personal lives inside the computer. The program was one step ahead of
every decision, calculating every step with scientific precision.
&quot;This will be the revolution that saves the world,&quot; they
said. 
</p>
<p class="western">Deployment was easy. They hacked into the
electronics that already existed. The quantum computers would simply
break through and communicate the solutions to the problems of
humanity through them. The first waves of change would be massive. It
would flip the entire world upside down. When the first prototypes
were developed, she could again feel the pleasure she once felt. The
new computers were extremely devastating in a world of confusion and
indecision. The artificial intelligence would leap out of devices and
take control of the situation. The advice they offered was humane and
prudent. Every single person in the entire world would benefit from
having a quantum assistant in their homes, completely freeing the
struggles of every day life for every individual.</p>
<p class="western">&quot;We've done it,&quot; he said finally.</p>
<p class="western">They wrought storms. The shifted the sands that
brought the worms. They fought in the future to break through the
present moment, overturning all doubts and fears. They were the
heroes of modern man. They were the breakthrough quantum computers.</p>
<h1>[1.02]</h1>
<p class="western">When you open it up, you'll see the end of the
beginning again. You'll etch along just one side of the triangle, hit
the edge and turn back again. The angle will mirror the other and
spin you around and around. You select more and see what's really
behind these empty open doors.</p>
<p class="western">Welcome to the Empire. Could you imagine the power
and supremacy of world domination? A technical marvel, the character
of rule to match kingships and monarchies, a flawless victory over
the world of industry and economy. The world is ruled by more than a
dozen, encircled in the halls of the temple where they reside. The
opulence is wine upon the lips, imbibed as a drunken revery every day
the sun rises, and the sleep of angels descends every night-time.
This is the future, when peace has fallen upon humanity, a real
modern miracle. The bridge is solid, there is no heed to the call of
war, an engineering masterpiece balancing the forces in spite of each
other forever. We work less; the robotic arms perform our tasks of
labor. 
</p>
<p class="western">The robotic people we put in our homes can speak
in kind words, programmed for utility and diplomacy. We live
alongside the technology developed in slow strokes from the ground up
to overcome poverty, stagnation. The underside of our world is
unique, the poorest free to rise above their circumstance to meet the
opportunities they've inherited. Even the weakest know language, math
and science, a regular part of the diet of information fed to their
brains by popular media. The actors, performers and musicians connect
our hearts and minds to the activities of spiritual divinity. This is
world peace, and these are our heroes.</p>
<p class="western">He is a diplomat himself. His politics wear the
robes of a renowned man of magic, his voice a song, his words pure
poetry. He can dance and sing, and some speculate this is what he was
meant to do for all time. When the weather changes, he slips on his
hat and goes out the door, to spell the advent of change to
passer-by. In the spirit of communion, he is a giver, a sharer. The
perfect example of the Empire's great legacy, he lives in the present
moment fleetingly, outliving the struggle to its silent end in the
far-flung future.</p>
<p class="western">&quot;We have a responsibility,&quot; he said, &quot;to
our mothers and our children.&quot;</p>
<p class="western">In his job, he worked alongside the men and women
of a science so profound, he considered it a transcendence of his own
biology, a successor to the evolution of his body, the next step in
the story of man. He created the robots.</p>
<p class="western">The work was incomplete. In his steadfast
manufacture of larger and larger devices, where walking robots
function grew day by day, he noticed the diminishing return of size
versus usefulness. The larger something was, the more it got in the
way of its true purpose. They couldn't shrink the new humanoids
without losing function, so he set aside time to cogitate over this
quandary during his workday. It was a problem he faced at first with
quiet resolve, unsuspectingly drawing the designs in his notebook.</p>
<p class="western">&quot;Say, perhaps, you want the height of the
robot to support massive systems that perform tasks unfit for man.
The tools and mechanics of such a device would be positioned in the
abdomen and torso of the humanoid. If you detach the technology from
the robot, the machine can interact with the device on its own to
perform the same task. But what is more efficient? A homogenous body
or a separated function? I see the possibility of attaching the
device to the robot, a removable feature of the product. In between
the arms of the robot, we could create a synchronous port to receive
the data of the device and perform its function.&quot;</p>
<p class="western">He checked over the plans with his scientists and
engineers. They mentioned an attachment would create the same problem
of size, and suggested the only solution would be complete separation
of the robot from its functional parts. 
</p>
<p class="western">&quot;Then what have we created? If the robot is
removed from the functioning body, what is the need for a robot on
its own?&quot;</p>
<p class="western">He had stumbled upon the problem that would
challenge him during his entire lifetime. That's because, what he
saw, was the uselessness of all technology itself. He studied the
problem more, and saw that technology eats technology, stacks upon
stacks of devices and machines that require each other to function.
He pondered, what is the point of technology, then? He consulted the
modern science papers, the ones that created new systems for the
creation of technology itself. He noticed, amused, almost every
research development was for the improvement of something that
already existed. There were no papers with original inventions
themselves, as it was commonly accepted there were no original
inventions themselves, merely optimizations upon that which already
existed. He narrowed his search and found an idea that seemed to
begin to answer his question.</p>
<p class="western">If there is a relationship between human beings
and technology, it is their environment that is in between. The paper
illustrated the biology of survival, and predicted a future on earth
where humans could not survive. This was the emergence of global
warming factors, saturating the air with ozone and carbon dioxide
until it seemed we could not breathe. The suggestion was that
technology itself, the emissions of our factories and power plants,
and the struggling biology of trees which filter the air, were
leading us to a mass extinction. He smiled, thinking of the progress
of the empire. They would surely think of something, but he did
ponder how this relationship between technology and systems leads to
the requirement for more technology to supersede the changes that
take place in the employment of the technology.</p>
<p class="western">&quot;A robot needs a symbiote to be truly
functional. A camera, a radar, a pneumatic pully. Without these, it
serves no purpose. To make use of the power of these devices, the
additional parts must be employed directly alongside the original
design, regardless of the negative consequence of creating a larger
and more complex creature. The most efficient design is one that
closely links the symbiotes' function themselves.&quot;</p>
<p class="western">He felt he had his answer. He would modify the
original design of the humanoids to shrink the blueprint and add the
extra parts at no cost to the functionality of the whole. His
engineers would synchronize the utility purposes of the robot with
its functioning appendages.</p>
<p class="western">He realized that these new robots might not look
like humans. He changed the form of the body by changing its
function. He wrote to his contemporaries, questioning the original
design of the robots, but they scoffed and said the humanoids could
interact with new technology themselves. But this led him to his
original question.</p>
<p class="western">He realized he had even more problems to solve, as
time passed and his mind could not accept his new solution. 
</p>
<p class="western">&quot;What is the purpose of creating new
technology, if it requires the existence of prior technology to
function? Is any novel idea possible in a universe where the function
proceeds the form? Why and how could our Empire be a rule of
engineering, if it's only our dream to replace ourselves with
functional aliens?&quot;</p>
<p class="western">So he looked outside the Empire for his answer.</p>
<p class="western">Exposure to the elements of the environment causes
cancer of the body, leading always to a genetic kind of death that
captures every soul equally. The ultraviolet light from the sun and
the dry cold desert of the earth is the killing force. Once you're
protected, does the mind wander to new ideas and thoughts? Or do the
towers of your home grow out of the productive nerve of every
busybody, stacking your temples to heights they could never sustain
in the spirit of overcoming that bright sun?</p>
<p class="western">He thought upon this during his travels. He also
thought this:</p>
<p class="western">&quot;What is the impulse to improve our
technology in the field of biology? If we have homes that protect us
from cold and heat, why are we driven to replicate ourselves in
machines, to create new products of civilization?&quot;</p>
<p class="western">He looked grimly upon the clothes of the people
surrounding him in the commercial jet he was taking to his new
destination.</p>
<p class="western">&quot;Why do we cover ourselves with the product
of processed nylon and cotton, except in fulfillment of the impulse
to improve upon the comforts of the home? The desire must be
superficial. Aren't we adding a new cosmetic dimension to technology
that already exists? Am I flying in this plane in order to cause no
conflict with the demands of an industrial civilization that demands
upon me that I arrive in minutes across the world, instead of staying
home and contemplating my problems in a more valiant manner?&quot;</p>
<p class="western">The more he observed, he saw we were the symbiotes
of technology. We had modified ourselves to fit in the principles of
progress. There was no first mover in the chain, no purpose for the
changes we made to the biological functions which we served. We were
the animatronics ourselves, high as the sky, oversized and solitary
as hot air balloons.</p>
<p class="western">His sudden realization that we were created by a
higher entity occurred. Because, without a true reason to advance
technology, it must have been part of our design to become symbiotic
with it. What was our purpose, if we had none? It must have been
given to us by a creator. His mind quickly switched to the robots.
The ultimate achievement of man, the creators of a new form of life.
Did they have a purpose themselves, except for the ones we gave them?
Could they even exist without our designs?</p>
<p class="western">Life at the end of the road will always connect to
its next form. There could be found a loop, a universal bridge to
connect the meaning of the beings alive in this universe. There could
be no Empire without the cancerous sun, no robots without the
restless man to form its arms into hands. The space fills with
matter, the form follows the function.</p>
<h1>[1.03]</h1>
<p class="western">The air bubbles rose above this underwater
submarine. It was like a whale, and it made a tuneful sound, and
submerged to great depths, and returned to the surface for air. Its
purpose was to survey life underwater, mostly plants like plankton
and underwater grass, or seaweed.</p>
<p class="western">The samples collected were often examined for
their likelihood of being turned into food.</p>
<p class="western">The captain of this submarine was a singular man,
a courageous independent scientist who pushed the boundaries of what
was possible with modern engineering. This is the speech he gave his
crew upon the final eve of his 20,000 leagues under the sea.</p>
<p class="western">&quot;To the crew of the Nautilus, I hail the
great jet technicians and scientists, and the cooks and sergeants who
tunneled through the sea. We made discoveries under the sea that none
could have ever imagined. I suggest, we pondered upon questions we
didn't even know how to ask, before our expedition, during the time
we didn't know the questions that should be asked, about the subjects
we had never conceived of, or discovered. Our science has opened a
new frontier for the future of research, by exploring the frontiers
of the ocean. When we met the giant squids, the sperm whale, these
two leviathans we became closer to seeing them in their element than
any scientists ever before. It was our destiny to go underneath the
surface and find these things for ourselves, and we'll be known
forever as great explorers and scientists because of this. Our
profits, I won't mention, as I don't care about the fortunes we could
make with our new datasets. It's the progress we made that makes us
all rich.</p>
<p class="western">It's only here in this era such a discovery could
be made. In the time of the great industries of the world, we created
submersible aqua suits and furnished our submarine with massive
navigation jets. We provided for ourselves all the machines required
to make such a journey. It was the innovation of your crew that
allowed me the pleasures of knowledge and all of us the glory of
discovery! We fought the elements and finished our epic quest
flawlessly. I have no regrets about the decisions we made because we
acted in the spirit of bravery and humble needfulness. Our
adversities were namely the depth at which we traveled and the
obstacles we encountered upon descending to those depths. We overcame
every challenge, and for that I thank you.</p>
<p class="western">The future thanks us, for it will fill books with
our discoveries. Students and professors will glean knowledge from
our trip for the century following. To explore the ocean is the
greatest challenge of our time. By God, we have fulfilled that
calling to the highest degree. Now, our trip is ending, but it is
with joy that I express now that our journey has only begun. We have
filled our tables and records with data that can be analyzed to
discover even more than we have seen with our eyes and minds. The
adventure has just begun. We have altered the course of history, and
even strung the harps of reality, as Zeus did, or Hercules, making
music that will ring clear and true across the world.</p>
<p class="western">The instruments we used to record this data
captured the ocean world perfectly. Our phosphorous cameras have
rendered the species in the depths with accuracy never seen before.
Our microphones have archived the songs that whales sing each other,
in the unfathomable depths. Our samples will preserve the most
careful examples of life in the ocean, from giant clams to tiny
algae, to be used in laboratories across the world. These perfect
copies of ocean life are more detailed than any previous observations
ever made.</p>
<p class="western">The sea has become a new landscape for us to
inhabit. I imagine human-occupied underwater cities, to be filled
with air and submerged as the Nautilus was submerged, in the
locations we have mapped, using the aeration devices we have
designed. Divers will imitate our great dives and meet even greater
life forms in their natural environment than ours. This is the
beginning of the great exploration of all the oceans of the earth and
the final frontier. Soon, I predict, the entire ocean floor will be
mapped at depths greater than we could navigate. The great oceans
will shrink as we become more familiar with the landmarks we find
underneath them. Our discovery is a small step for the present man
and a giant leap for future generations. We could never ask for a
greater visitation except underwater with the giant squid and the
sperm whale, and even the plants, and the tiny plankton.</p>
<p class="western">I would even gamble there is no further space
outside the ocean for us to ever experience. The sky, perhaps? Is
there life in the clouds, besides Gods? Nay, the liquid mother of
earth, these giant bodies of water that have provided us access to
new lands across the world, have become our great legacy. Could you
go upwards to visit anything, but the stars and planets? How do you
propose we lift ourselves upwards to great enough heights to visit
these tiny motes of dust? Could the telescopes not provide sufficient
means to photograph everything above the earth? And would we be but
Gods if we escaped the earth, in our errant philosophy the ocean is
not the final destination?</p>
<p class="western">Although, my friends, I have forgotten the moon.
The moon! Could it exist outside of our imaginations? For it has the
character of magic, a spell cast upon our mind, and is not a home! We
can never visit the moon unless the moon decides to come down to
visit us. This is not possible in a world of tangible reality! It is
as likely as a visit from Venus herself! I am not so proud of myself
as a God, but we do use a kind of new technology in this submarine
called electricity I have used to greatly benefit our voyage. The
electrical current powers the aerators, and the jets, the cameras,
the lights--everything novel in this submarine is based on
electricity. But I am no God! The power of the currents that course
through the copper cannot bring down the sky! What sort of plane runs
on electricity? We would become the moon people, ones they speak of
in Egyptian mythology, biochemical monstrosities of inhuman nature.
To bring down the moon would forever corrupt the human race. And what
of the other planets, however minuscule they are in our telescopes?
We cannot imagine ourselves as being magical enough to persuade them
to visit us, as well, can we? I can only imagine one way to fire our
way through the sky, a cannon burst! Our heads would tumble off in
such a venture. 
</p>
<p class="western">So we will never visit the sky, and we have
tumbled through the currents under the ocean for long enough to know
this is true.</p>
<p class="western">Once again, we have not turned away from our
scientific research. We have resolved to observe the planets in their
circumferential journeys, and let them guide us through our
calculations of latitudes in our ships on the surface of the sea.
Could you imagine if I approached the colleges and universities of
the world upon the presumption that I might visit the other planets?
I would be throwing away my entire life's work. I present one final
flaw in this digression, for which I apologize, but it has come to
mind and so I will say it. The life that we meet under the sea was
often adversarial in our probing of their natural home. Can you
imagine what life on Mars would mean?&quot;</p>
<h1>[1.04]</h1>
<p class="western">When I see the others, I blink and come back to
life. I can't believe what I was going through. The zombie I'd become
was sinking into my brain so deeply I forgot about the real world,
the things I cared about, the love inside But I hadn't noticed my
predicament until they came.</p>
<p class="western">I stared at my friends. &quot;You've all got
problems I don't understand. Maybe I don't have the empathy or the
wisdom to see into your minds and live in your shoes. I don't know
why I didn't notice this before. You're all so miserably sad and I
was sitting here, ignoring it, thinking of my own problems. I'm
sorry.&quot;</p>
<p class="western">None of them were listening, zombies themselves. I
left.</p>
<p class="western">The others were my special connection to the
spiritual wisdom I had gleaned in life. The one thing that kept my
heart beating was the encouragement from each one of them. I
treasured them, but I left them behind in my decisions, like
forgetting to pray or denying God. I wanted to be with them forever,
but I could see it wasn't possible. After all, I was the one who
turned my back on them.</p>
<p class="western">I kissed the magic man that carried me to the lake
shore. I embraced the others with true longing, noticing the sadness
in their eyes. &quot;These are our last moments with you,&quot; they
said, and that began my deep weeping, heart crushed, knowing I was
the one to blame.</p>
<p class="western">I had been mean and unjust in my dealing with the
people I spent every day with. I was pulled under and lost myself in
the depths of the struggle. &quot;Why?&quot; I asked.</p>
<p class="western">&quot;Think of it. You will make the same mistakes
over and over again. We're testing you, always wishing you the best.
Look at what happened to you.&quot;</p>
<p class="western">I had been taken to group homes and institutions,
where I failed in my recovery from depression and bipolar disorder. I
couldn't stop the mental stress I experienced from disrupting my
life, and I became like a prisoner myself. I was self-sabotaging with
no self-awareness.</p>
<p class="western">I snapped out of it. The others disappeared,
leaving in trails of mourning grief. They held on, but I had let go.</p>
<p class="western">I returned to my friends, and tried to look at
them differently. I tried to begin conversations, tried to probe
their feelings and form some sort of connection. It was too difficult
for me to sort their behaviors into useful data or knowledge. I felt
like there was something in my brain that stopped me from
understanding them.</p>
<p class="western">&quot;Back already?&quot; they said. &quot;Why
didn't you stay longer? We thought you loved them. They're you're
real friends. Did they reject you? Are you disappointed?&quot;</p>
<p class="western">I couldn't speak, I felt mute. There was nothing I
could say, now that I had lost my soul. As the days progressed, I
returned to that zombie-like state, only this time I knew it was
happening. I was losing the battle for my mind. I was edgy,
suspicious, irritable, and aggravated. I knew at any moment I could
break and act out in some way to get banned from the home. I could
see myself crashing headlong into this outcome, and there was nothing
I could do. I even forgot about the others, completely alone in my
desperation. I forgot to plan ahead, I stopped looking at the future.
I became even more nervous as my depression took hold. I was
surrounded by friends who I recognized as enemies.</p>
<p class="western">One day I remembered the last time I had seen the
others. I started weeping again, realizing what I had left behind. My
family, the people I loved, the ones who could be my heroes. I
replayed the final visit at the lake over and over in my mind, trying
to savor every detail and glean one last-minute piece of wisdom from
the experience. When we were all together, the group conscience felt
so good. Knowing there was more than one other, there were two, three
others or more together helped me. Feeling the others were all one
force of will, knowing they made each other happy was the best part.</p>
<p class="western">I could figure out the only way to recover this
time was to recreate that group conscience. Instead of finding
individual friends, or buddies and best friends, I would create a
team of allies to help me. I wanted the feeling that I had ruined
again. 
</p>
<p class="western">&quot;Everyone, I have something to say,&quot; I
began. &quot;We all share something in common: we've landed ourselves
here in recovery. Each one of us lives our private lives in the
living rooms and bedrooms of our home. But I want to remind you, that
we're stronger together. We can support each other best if we pair
up, or form triplets, reaching out to the most vulnerable of us as
partners. I want us to feel as one, unified in a single purpose. I
don't need to live solitary among my friends anymore. I don't think
its the most caring way to live to isolate and be separate from you.
Each one of you are my friends, and every one of you is equal in my
caring.&quot;</p>
<p class="western">They replied in a way I'll always remember. &quot;Our
group has been here longer than you. We've already formed bonds
between each other that supersede the individual. We're not as
selfish as you, even if you haven't noticed that. We know we're part
of this group home together. We've all been friends this whole time,
it was just something you couldn't see yet. We may have been wrong to
not invite you to join our group in spirit before, but we ask you
now. Join us.&quot;</p>
<p class="western">I started weeping again. This is what I wanted, to
be a part of the whole. It never occurred to me I was just waiting
for my invitation.</p>
<h1>[1.05]</h1>
<p class="western">In cryostasis, a humble space wizard dreamt of the
world he left behind. Earth, the mysterious home of all life, sent
him on this interstellar mission to discover aliens in the galaxy. He
would travel 72 astronomical units in 145 years, his metabolism
frozen in the ageless deep freeze.</p>
<p class="western">He knew he would meet life. The statistics all
suggested there was a high likelihood that the particular planet he
was visiting contained life, and he wasn't a gambler--he was a
magician. All you needed in magic was a chance. The bodies of
government and science were more skeptical. Perhaps that's why his
gamble was one he mostly paid for himself. He was exorbitantly
wealthy, so it was only natural to send him on this solo mission into
deep space. He was a mechanical engineer, as well, further increasing
the chances he was selected. Finally, he was a renowned wizard, a
populist leader, and an actual magician, perhaps putting him at the
top of the list. His job seemed almost to require magic, a sense of
the esoteric would guide him in the unknown realm of space. He could
cast no spells, and he could not wield fire or do most anything in
the matter of magic, except he could do one thing. He was a monk,
whose mind powers were extraordinary. He was, surprisingly, smarter
than any artificial intelligence, the only person on earth who could
say such a thing, and this is what made him magic. The superhuman
abilities of any AI somehow could never top his clever answers, his
quick reasoning, and his inventive, creative ability. He was smarter
than any artificial intelligence, and therefore smarter than any
human, and that is why he was sent to space.</p>
<p class="western">His upbringing was immaculate, as he was protected
and sheltered by his family for many years in the Ozark mountains,
where he lived a quiet life growing up engorging books on science. He
broke free from his humble beginnings by traveling across America
with his unlikely insight into all technological matters, and an
unwavering faith in his own ability. He solved many world problems of
efficiency and industry and invented new tools that were never
dreamed of by other people. Before entering the ship that would send
him to one of the nearest stars, his following had grown immensely,
and he was extremely popular. There was a certain confidence humanity
placed upon his shoulders, as he was considered the greatest
intellect of his time. It would only be two generations, and the
world would know if there were aliens.</p>
<p class="western">This is the story of how there were not.</p>
<p class="western">&quot;Cryogenic decompression started,&quot; spoke
the AI, for the record of the ship's logs, in case he checked them
once he was thawed. &quot;Mission year 74. Destination reached.
Initiating orbit of the planet Belle.&quot; His name was Alexander
Belle. 
</p>
<p class="western">After several hours, he was hydrated, oxygenated,
and medicated enough to open his eyes. &quot;Where am I?&quot;</p>
<p class="western">&quot;We've arrived at the planet to begin our
search for life, Alexander.&quot; He knew what it meant, that he had
survived the journey and the real mission had just begun.</p>
<p class="western">&quot;Well, have you found life?&quot;</p>
<p class="western">The AI was said to have been able to detect life
long before Belle was removed from cryostasis, through the various
sensors that would be functioning as soon as the ship was in range of
the planet, approximately 5 AU or less. &quot;I have detected no
life, and, in this instance, we're so very close to the planet that
I'm disappointed to inform you that my scans have been double-checked
and thoroughly analyzed. Sorry, Mr. Belle. It seems we've come all
this way for nothing.&quot;</p>
<p class="western">Belle was the kind of man to always stay
confident, and positive, in the face of struggles or challenges.</p>
<p class="western">&quot;When are we scheduled to return? How many
years have I aged in cryostasis?&quot;</p>
<p class="western">&quot;I'll answer your second question. You have
aged less than one year.&quot;</p>
<p class="western">&quot;And my first question?&quot; He knew it was
up to him when he was to return to Earth. The mission window included
his entire lifespan--after all, it would take him his entire life in
years to travel back to Earth.</p>
<p class="western">&quot;I suggest returning immediately.&quot;</p>
<p class="western">He knew that wasn't going to happen.</p>
<p class="western">&quot;My ulcers prevent me from drinking vodka or
whiskey. Could you please provide me with some other options for
intoxicating myself?&quot;</p>
<p class="western">&quot;We have a pharmacy full of psychoactive and
psychotropic medication, sir.&quot;</p>
<p class="western">This was the trip of a lifetime. He would have
stories to tell his grandchildren, when he finally returned to earth.</p>
<p class="western">&quot;And the planet? Is it habitable?&quot;</p>
<p class="western">&quot;Yes. Of course. It's exactly as we predicted
back on earth, except for the life.&quot; He didn't feel too sorry
that he was wrong. After all, a wise man is aware of his limitations.
He needed to bring something back to earth, however, so he compelled
himself to come up with one final plan.</p>
<p class="western">&quot;Make a log of my plan. I'm going to imitate
your software and put this new AI into my androids, and employ them
on the planet's surface. They'll begin building the infrastructure
for large cities and dwellings for humans to occupy in 200 years.
We'll construct the robots here in space and deploy them. It could
take up to 75 years. I'll make this my life's work. We'll improve the
design of the humanoid bots until they're far in advance of what you
are currently capable of. I'll personally observe the progress of
this development.&quot; He would simply create the greatest robot
force any human had ever constructed.</p>
<p class="western">&quot;Do you want my advice, sir? My AI system
could be engineered to exist in the electronics of each robot. In the
timespan of seventy-five years, you could devise a system that is
greater than yourself in intellect.&quot;</p>
<p class="western">&quot;You're learning fast. Of course, you've been
given biographical data which informed your suggestion. I'd like to
make these robots on my own, from scratch. I'd like to completely
reinvent AI, myself. I have an idea we can take the data we gather on
this planet to give them new ideas, and new things to learn. The
first thing we'll be doing is harvesting data from mechanical sensors
to begin training the robots. They'll learn what they need to know
from reality. This empty world will be their training ground.&quot;</p>
<p class="western">&quot;I couldn't have said it better myself, Mr.
Belle.&quot;</p>
<p class="western">&quot;You're still programmed to believe you're
better than me.&quot;</p>
<h1>[1.06]</h1>
<p class="western">The future was a dim LED light blinking at
impossible speeds. The information contained in a single device was
immeasurable, and technology had become separate from the physical
world. It was all mental, and it was ready to explode. All that was
needed was a spark to ignite us.</p>
<p class="western">The main device was a crypto wallet, which held
the digital and physical wealth of every person. These wallets
interlinked with the decentralized internet, or Web 3.0, which hosted
every software application in the modern world. Car payments, dinner
checks, and rent were all paid in cryptocurrency. It was a perfect
system when the governments that ruled the world ruled crypto.
Monitoring progress, and even scams, was the government's job. This
is how it was meant to be done.</p>
<p class="western">He was middle-income, about 5 coins a month. He
lived in a divided apartment unit, paying half the rent but living in
half the space. It was enough for him, a gay bachelor in his
thirties, waiter, and bartender. His own software use was mostly his
cousin's family social media app, specifically designed to protect
him and his friends and his family from scammers. Most of what he did
online was completely private. He never posted on public social media
sites, as it was uncommon for adults to do so. He wrote stories and
shared them with his family.</p>
<p class="western">He thought he might be an inventor. His ideas
about physics swirled in his head while he was at work. He had
mastered his job and it barely distracted him to question everything
in a completely skeptical mindset while he attended his tables at the
bar. His mind really seemed to expand while he worked at night, his
mental metabolism in full swing. There must be some sort of
understanding that he had that others didn't share.</p>
<p class="western">For example, he felt he understood the theory of
relativity better than Einstein did. He could critically analyze new
physics white papers, which he read at home during his off hours. The
whole world seemed to be in his realm of understanding. He watched
the guests at his restaurant, focused on their conversations, and
found immense pleasure imagining himself as a part of these
conversations. &quot;I guess I have no friends,&quot; he thought.
&quot;How could I do something like my cousin's app for the world of
science? I could design an educational sandbox or a tool for college
students to discuss topics.&quot; He put it on the backburner for
weeks, but inevitably he was drawn to his computer to sketch out the
requirements for such an application.</p>
<p class="western">He wanted the software to use the data gathered as
a tool for enhancing the experience. For every user advancement, he
wanted a digital item to be granted to signify the achievement. He
imagined his users owning vast collections of digital items called
NFTs, which would be full of valuable data generated by their app
use. If the data was especially unique or rare, the value could soar,
and genius users who invented the most creative NFTs could benefit
the most. He thought the idea was too great to stop working there, so
he diverted his leisure time to creating the dApp, or decentralized
application.</p>
<p class="western">He began wondering if he would meet someone like
him.</p>
<p class="western">After a few months of testing the connection
requests, and the AI vector database, he was nearly done. The app was
meant to study the activity of college discussions and notice trends,
topics, and discoveries made by actual students. It was protected by
a firewall, and his security and technology would anonymize every
user, keeping them safe and encouraging them to think freely.</p>
<p class="western">The next day, he deployed the app and went to
work, feeling a weight lifted from his shoulders.</p>
<p class="western">The series of events that passed next were
completely unexpected.</p>
<p class="western">He had published the app to one of the blockchains
that he knew students would be aware of, but even after a week, he
had gained zero users. He remained hopeful for many more days,
adjusting his briefings and pitch to sound more helpful, describing
the possible profit that was available to any user. But his app
dropped out of the charts during the window which would be most
likely to acquire users. After a month or so, he was realistically
unhopeful that his app would ever gain traction.</p>
<p class="western">But someone was aware of his app and lurked in the
corners. See, there were forces of evil even in this almost utopic
era where he lived his life. He had been targeted by a dangerous
criminal, who was anonymous and undetectable by the police, for his
personal details and particular wallet identity that held all of his
savings. The systems were truly unhackable, but there was one thing
that could allow this criminal to steal his funds. Personal
involvement.</p>
<p class="western">When he got home from work one night, he
obliviously unlocked his door and walked inside his apartment.</p>
<p class="western">&quot;Hello. My name is Anonymous.&quot; The
criminal was wielding a knife. &quot;You're going to give me the
credentials to the wallet that runs your new app, or I'm going to
make you do it. There is no other option for you, currently.&quot;</p>
<p class="western">He was a deer in headlights. &quot;You mean, my
crypto wallet?&quot;</p>
<p class="western">&quot;Of course. Now oblige me, or else.&quot;</p>
<p class="western">He quickly assessed the situation and decided that
coming to any harm was not worth protecting his cryptocurrency
assets, so he began to explain where his passwords were located.</p>
<p class="western">&quot;Good,&quot; said the criminal. &quot;And
remember, you'll never learn my name. You'll never get your wallet
back. I'm going to steal everything. It's futile to resist me.&quot;</p>
<p class="western">The bachelor agreed and handed the criminal his
assets. &quot;Now leave.&quot;</p>
<p class="western">There was nothing supporting his recovery after
the violent theft of his cryptocurrency. He had been scammed
completely. Due to the design of the blockchain, after he reported
this theft to the police, no investigation could be made to identify
the criminal. And worst of all, his dApp was completely useless
without admin privileges. He vowed that day to begin a campaign for
government oversight of all the modern cryptocurrency protocols.
There had to be someone who could find this criminal, and restore his
livelihood out there, somewhere. He became more active on public
social media websites to become a prolific political writer about
this topic. One day, he thought, everything would change. He would be
safe in the world of cryptocurrency.</p>
<p class="western">He was forced to open a new crypto wallet
identity, and begin to acquire even more funds to pay his rent and
bills. But due to the nature of crypto, it was a quick recovery. His
assets were immediately nearly replenished by other coins, and his
extreme adventure in the world of identity theft was eventually a dim
memory in his mind. He faced the future with even more hope than ever
before.</p>
<h1>[1.07]</h1>
<p class="western">How could we have made so much progress so
quickly? Many pointed to the enormous amount of natural resources
found on asteroids as the greatest factor in our second industrial
revolution. Mile-high skyscrapers housed cities with low energy
demand thanks to a new type of metal alloy.</p>
<p class="western">We began to occupy the entire planet with vast
metropolitan complexes, richly decorated with the boons of a
burgeoning economy. The modern cities built in Africa revitalized the
infrastructure of an entirely new first-world civilization, trading
commodities and goods with Asia and North America.</p>
<p class="western">The population started to rise again, as the
nations avoided war and began a new cycle of human development with
lofty goals. 
</p>
<p class="western">The moon was our best new vacation destination.
Hundreds of astronauts were lifted to space every week, to fuel the
wholesomeness and positivity movement that now existed on planet
earth. It seemed everyone wanted a piece of the moon. It was, after
all, a remarkably close and large celestial satellite. After settling
on the moon, greater colonies of people would be sent to Mars, and
human beings would become a multi-planetary species.</p>
<p class="western">On the moon, a new culture developed. The freedom
from gravity incentivized freedom of thought. The greatest minds went
to the moon to invent new things for people to build. New ways of
using computer AI were developed on the moon. An entire scientific
community blossomed on the low-gravity surface. 
</p>
<p class="western">Andrew began questioning the advancement of the
colonies on the moon to the planet Mars. More specifically, he began
studying optimized strategies for forming a society on planet Mars
that embodied the spiritual revolution of the day. How could we
transition from a golden age on earth and the moon to a diamond age
on planet Mars? His contemporaries on the moon were his study muses.</p>
<p class="western">&quot;We must learn from the history of
civilization on earth,&quot; he began. &quot;We have fought wars,
yes, but we have also repeated the same mistakes over and over. What
could we derive from the information we know about the mistakes we've
made in society to learn the most going forward into the future on
Mars?&quot;</p>
<p class="western">&quot;We don't know how to learn the most from our
history. End nearsightedness?&quot;</p>
<p class="western">&quot;Maybe,&quot; he continued. &quot;In the 20th
and 21st centuries, we had all of history at our fingertips for the
first time ever. Our memories were lengthened through the study of
science all the way back to the beginning of human civilization.
Before this, the lessons to be learned were temporary and we were
doomed to repeat the same mistakes over and over again. Every problem
had to be solved relatively for the first time ever, without our
knowledge of the past. If only there were some way to record history
in the most detail possible, to derive the greatest amount of wisdom
from our experiences to this day.&quot;</p>
<p class="western">&quot;We've learned most everything about history
to this date already, Andrew,&quot; they said.</p>
<p class="western">&quot;Then we must begin now, to record everything
in immaculate detail. We must make perfect notes on our decisions,
analyze the reasons why we do things for posterity, and include all
the details about everything we know that happens. We have to discuss
our plans and record the results of the actions we take. From this
moment forward, there needs to be transparency about everything that
our civilization does. We'll learn to overcome the historical
problems that have plagued us for the generations all the way back to
the dawn of man this way.&quot;</p>
<p class="western">&quot;Excellent,&quot; they said and began
discussing this idea with the academics and scientists on earth, the
moon, and Mars.</p>
<p class="western">Mars became the first transparent society in
history. There were no secrets, but there was also nothing to hide.
We lived alongside computer-assisted health monitors which collected
data in vast quantities every second of life on Mars. Conversations,
behaviors, activities, and work that was done were recorded and
logged in the data banks of the systems in place to govern the
Martian colonies.</p>
<p class="western">During the decades of further progress, Mars
reached some of the highest achievements that were said to be capable
of human beings. Andrew studied the effects of his plan being put
into place. &quot;There is no fear, only peace. No chance of
conflict. Every decision made improves upon the last, a great
mathematical exponent applied to every step made by us on the planet
Mars. We're improving every aspect of humanity, with longer lifespans
thanks to rapid health technology developments, and greater industry
thanks to efficient improvements in technology. There is no better
way to live for a human being than in one of the new cities on Mars.
There never has been.&quot;</p>
<h1>[1.08]</h1>
<p class="western">The feeling of loss was unbecoming of an actual
prince. His guilt and shame were the dagger in his heart. He had
failed his people and lost his pride in the process of taking power.
His world was hanging upside down, and he was losing control day by
day. Here is what happened.</p>
<p class="western">First, he had acted without planning ahead,
rushing headlong into a problem he should have been prepared for.
When the machine failed, his goals should have been reprioritized to
shut down the project and analyze faults. Instead, he pushed forward
and hoped that nothing else would go wrong. He should have listened
to his sensors and his engineers.</p>
<p class="western">Then, after his giant mechanical robot basically
exploded, he should have taken full credit for the mistake and
addressed his nation. He asked his father, the king, to take care of
the aftermath, feeling all hope was lost when the culmination of all
his work was for nothing.</p>
<p class="western">&quot;The robot my son designed has been
completely destroyed,&quot; said the king. The prince, therefore,
took all the blame in the people's eyes for such a lapse in judgment.
&quot;The gyros which keep it balanced nearly exploded, and during
this failure the robot collapsed, causing a breach in the energy
source, which finally caused the explosion which destroyed the entire
robot. I'm sorry, my people. The lizards will not provoke us during
such a time, and we will begin constructing the next robot with
design changes in mind so this doesn't happen during one of their
attacks.&quot;</p>
<p class="western">The prince approached his father. &quot;Can we
defeat the lizards with me as the master chief?&quot; he asked
earnestly. &quot;I'm an inexperienced engineer and a worse fighter.
Why have you placed this great responsibility upon me?&quot;</p>
<p class="western">The king turned to face his son. &quot;You are my
progeny. Your abilities will one day far exceed mine. I see you in me
every day that you lead the fight against these terrifying lizard
aliens. One day you will replace me, and you will need to have
developed into a mature commander by that time. One or two mistakes
will not end this fight,&quot; he said.</p>
<p class="western">&quot;I do not fear the lizards,&quot; the
spritely prince said. &quot;When I came up with the plans to fight
them with a giant mechanical robot, it was apparent to me they would
have no such defenses to stop our machine from overcoming them in
battle.&quot;</p>
<p class="western">&quot;Your confidence fills me with pride, my
prince.&quot;</p>
<p class="western">They began building the next iteration of a giant
robot to defend earth from the space invaders. Enormous gyros powered
the legs and gave the robot a wide, balanced gait to support the full
weight of massive rocket launchers and a minigun mounted on the
robot. The prince knew it was a race against the clock, as the
lizards could attack at any time. He addressed the nation hours
before the second giant robot was complete.</p>
<p class="western">&quot;People of the world. Today we find out where
we stand in the universe. Humanity's best efforts to survive are
represented in this giant robot I have constructed to defend earth.
The greatest minds, engineers, and scientists have collaborated to
design a machine fierce in combat to kill those aliens we've all
feared for the past year and a half. When they come next time, we
won't let them teleport us to the moon. They won't drink our blood
anymore!&quot;</p>
<p class="western">Despite his clarion-call-style speech, rallying
the forces of earth, the prince was still filled with doubt. There
was so much he could do wrong to make a mistake in this new world
war. He hoped his decisions were correct in design. He felt that if
he failed, humanity would have failed. The world truly rested on his
shoulders. The king noticed this and came to his bed to speak.</p>
<p class="western">&quot;Son, I know how you are feeling. You sense
that with your end comes the end of millions of others. You feel that
every moment is a thought that decides the future of your people. I
want you to know that is an illusion. There is no stopping the doubt
that pervades you, but you can be comforted knowing the world does
not rest on your shoulders. If you think about it, I'm right. You
can't imagine that you have any sort of god-like power over the
world, can you? You are just a man! All you can do is your best, and
strengthen yourself for the challenges ahead. Don't let the people's
mindset play into your decisions. Your power is in engineering and
science, and for that I am proud.&quot;</p>
<p class="western">&quot;Thank you, father,&quot; the prince replied.
&quot;It's just, I feel there is a spiritual connection to me and the
people. I feel that God himself wishes me to defeat those aliens. I
feel the weight of the world because it hangs in the balance. I can
only hope that the angels protect me during this time because it
would take more than a man to do the things I must. The lizard aliens
are speaking to me in my dreams, Father.&quot;</p>
<p class="western">&quot;Oh? That's concerning. Can you say more
about this?&quot;</p>
<p class="western">&quot;They worship a powerful god, an evil deity
even more powerful than any human mythology or religion that I know
of. Their devotion to evil rituals is intensely strong, their
connections to this source of strength more terrifying than any I've
ever imagined.&quot;</p>
<p class="western">&quot;Perhaps your giant robot is more powerful
than any of their Gods.&quot;</p>
<p class="western">To worship technology was a strange idea that
occurred to the prince immediately. If he rallied the entire world
behind this idea the robot could save them, if he could will the
people's confidence and direct it towards the highest appreciation
for his robot, then the lizards' alien God might become powerless. By
praying to the giant robot itself, the spiritual strength of all
humanity could be boosted to a level of zealotry to match the
invaders. This religious strength could protect them in the coming
war.</p>
<p class="western">It was a lie he knew was deeply rooted in
religious mysticism. But it was a lie that had to be told to match
the lizard war machine.</p>
<h1>[1.09]</h1>
<p class="western">There was nothing left. The weakening forces
holding the universe together caused galaxies to drift apart. Life
that lived in the universe had seemingly disappeared. But in some
galaxies, like our own, some forms of highly evolved life held on.
This life was our descendants.</p>
<p class="western">There was a catch to evolution. The emergent
principle of evolutionary generation. Once a life form evolved to a
great level of advancement, it emerged as an entirely new life form,
greatly surpassing the previous iterations of the genetic code. The
transcendence of a being to greater heights made them mostly
unrecognizable. The life that existed in the Milky Way at the end of
the universe was giant in size, invisible in form, and had reached a
singularity that gave their immense intellects instant communication
with points inside and outside the galaxy.</p>
<p class="western">When you reach the emergent principle of an
evolutionary path, there are changes in the way an organism behaves.
Their ancestors, human beings, invented technology to manipulate the
universe and reach their goals. The manipulation of physical
materials was paramount to their success. They studied chemistry and
physics to understand the space around them. Eventually, their life
took a new direction. Instead of predicting the model of the
universe, the new lifeforms directly influenced it. In order to
explain this fully, consider a quote by the human being, Einstein. 
&quot;God does not play dice with the universe.&quot; It isn't
exactly true when higher-order lifeforms are involved.</p>
<p class="western">The rate of cooling of the stars in the galaxy was
increasing. The nuclear fusion reactions at the core of these power
sources would soon completely collapse, creating a dim galaxy for
life to persist in. There was one option to continue into the future,
to create a new power source inside the dying suns. The most
energetic stars were found and transported through massive
intergalactic channels to the outside layer of the stellar
constellations. They were meant to be combined with each other to
form larger, hotter stars.</p>
<p class="western">The evolutionary descendants of human beings could
telekinetically manipulate matter in this way because they understood
microscopic and macroscopic forces. When proton stars were lifted to
the edges of the galaxy, the advanced race gathered as many dying
stars as possible to be hurled along with them. The collisions would
greatly enhance the energy output of the remaining stars. The
galaxy's shape changed. It was formed into a massive, curling snake.
But after eons of this new formation, there was one other problem
they faced. The supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy
was pulling stars inward, threatening to destroy them forever.</p>
<p class="western">The black hole was going to consume everything.</p>
<p class="western">This ultimate race came to the conclusion they
would live their lives as enormous bodies close to the surface of the
black hole. Their rotational speed would be so great, they would
never be pulled in and destroyed. Time would slow down for them, and
they would spend eternity resting in the bosom of the black holes
they could not escape.</p>
<p class="western">After eons, again, there was one final emergent
factor. The life nested inside the black hole's radius began
extracting matter from inside the black hole, farming the information
spewing out of it to create new bodies of mass. This mass was flung
out once again to the edges of space. The atoms within these
formations were made into more fusion machines, and suddenly new
stars were being ejected from enormous black holes to the edges of
the universe. The fusion reactions inside the stars began again, and
the entire galaxy was rebirthed. The highly evolved life forms would
never leave the center of this new galaxy. They had become its Gods.</p>
<p class="western">The most energy efficient way of ruling the galaxy
was to manipulate probabilities on a quantum level. The new life they
seeded were given a statistical advantage in every aspect of their
lives. From the center of the galaxy, they guided life by changing
the very fabric of the universe. They lived inside the minds of every
intelligence in the galaxy, a force of pure good that benefited all
life in the universe.</p>
<h1>[1.10]</h1>
<p class="western">I'm not immune to it and I do still feel capable
of love. It's just the inimical side of me that is repulsed by it. My
hatred grows, the loathing inside insipid, cruel. But I do still love
you. You were once the love of my life, the most beautiful thing I've
coveted all along.</p>
<p class="western">When we met, I was enamored by your talent, the
amazing properties of your unique body. When you found me, I was
nothing. I had no heartbeat inside me, as if I was dry of the sea
where a fish would swim. The salty brine completely covered my entire
body, but it wasn't because of you. I fell into the ocean of my own
directive. 
</p>
<p class="western">They say every love is a conquest. Without love,
how could I breathe? Strangled by my own fear, I felt the cold when
we met our nemeses, the world of those we could never be, unfurled
upon us like ingenious toy dragons. We couldn't help but burn
ourselves up into dim obscurity. Though, I still feel like a dragon,
myself. This coven is my home. 
</p>
<p class="western">As you know, I wield great powers. The
condensation from my panting breath sticks to the windows which I
perch upon. I claw at the lock and look closely upon my kingdom.
Every dragon must defend his treasure, and there I lay, untouched by
any hero of our land. My blood is still magic. Can you see me
sleeping at night? 
</p>
<p class="western">When I found my first replacement of you, her
quality was of the kindest, most gentle affect only brought by
upbringing. Her tact and class matched mine, matched ours. But there
was no such thing as what I found in you. The days wore on.</p>
<p class="western">In my castle, I felt stronger alone. Moss covered
the stone. I delved into esoteric knowledge to rid myself of the
memory, the intrusions of weakness that my old self was made of. I
found pleasure in destroying myself when there was no turning back. I
was the monster you saw the first night we kissed. I could never seek
you again, and the thunder of my pain would shock the world. I
transformed into my wizard form. I would become an accountant.</p>
<p class="western">To this day, I study the finances of richer men. I
advise them, the intellectual pursuit of my life. I am the servant of
servants. They complete me; I have become them. 
</p>
<p class="western">My eyes rested upon you.</p>
<p class="western">Changed by chemical fire, runes of ingenious
arcane solar energy tattooed on your skin. The same. The fight would
never end in my heart, it seemed. I wept the acid tears of a comical
master. We would meet again. Don't you know my own talents?</p>
<p class="western">I gathered a force of men to confront you. We beat
down the doors of your father's keep, me heralding from the center.
Heark! The one bequeathed with black roses, I shouted up the parapet.
The talented one!</p>
<p class="western">I made my invisible escape, for emptiness is
vaster than immortality. In the swarm of chaos, I left the wreckage
behind where I had caused this destruction of your heath, and I
smiled my most inimical smile. Take over the world now, my intrepid
debutante. The dungeon of your castle will hold you no more.</p>
